description: "Use when creating or refactoring Python applications toward clean src package architecture with class-based use cases/services, focused boundaries, testing and tooling guardrails, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md repo instructions, and diwire Injected[...] dependency injection. Useful for Python clean architecture, DI, service boundary, framework adapter, pytest, ruff, mypy, uv, agent instructions, or moving logic out of delivery code tasks. Do not use for non-Python repos or generic formatting-only cleanup."

# Clean Architecture Skill

Use this skill to create or reshape Python repos toward pragmatic clean
architecture:

- `src/<package_name>` import-package layout;
- class-based use cases and focused services;
- clean delivery, core, infrastructure, entrypoint, and composition boundaries;
- dependency injection through `diwire` and `Injected[...]`;
- tests, tooling, style, and agent instructions that enforce the boundaries.

Keep the main file lean. Load the reference files below only when the task
touches that area.

## First Steps

Before editing an existing repo:

1. Read `pyproject.toml`, package layout, tests, framework entrypoints, existing
   dependency-injection/container code, and existing `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`
   files.
2. Find the import package name. Prefer the existing package under `src/`. If
   creating a new repo, derive it from the project name by normalizing to a valid
   Python identifier, for example `order-service` -> `order_service`.
3. Preserve behavior. Move code behind cleaner boundaries in small vertical
   slices instead of doing a broad rewrite.
4. Adapt delivery details to the framework the user names or the repo already
   uses. This skill is framework-agnostic.
5. Load only the references needed for the task.

## Reference Router

Read these files as needed:

| Task need | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Package layout, layers, use cases, services, boundaries, DTOs, schemas, and abstractions | [references/architecture.md](references/architecture.md) |
| `diwire`, `Injected[...]`, container creation, explicit registration, and test overrides | [references/diwire.md](references/diwire.md) |
| Pytest layout, unit/integration/architecture/style tests, fixtures, and boundary checks | [references/testing.md](references/testing.md) |
| `uv`, `ruff`, `mypy`, formatting, linting, type-checking, and pre-commit-style checks | [references/tooling.md](references/tooling.md) |
| Python class style, dataclass shape, naming, method signatures, imports, and small code snippets | [references/style.md](references/style.md) |
| Creating or updating target-repo `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files | [references/agent-instructions.md](references/agent-instructions.md) |
| Incremental migration workflow for existing repos | [references/migration.md](references/migration.md) |

If a task crosses multiple areas, read the smallest set of references that
covers it. For example, a new use case with tests usually needs
`architecture.md`, `diwire.md`, `style.md`, and `testing.md`.

## Hard Rules

Use these rules unless the existing repo has a stronger local convention:

- Application classes receive dependencies; they do not import a container or
  call `container.resolve()`.
- Only `ioc/`, outermost entrypoints, and tests may create or use
  `diwire.Container`.
- Use cases and services do not import delivery concerns such as routers,
  request/response schemas, CLI parsers, task decorators, or framework objects.
- External IO and framework-bound dependencies live at the edge or behind a
  justified adapter.
- Do not introduce an ABC, interface, or protocol just because dependency
  injection is present.
- Use ABC classes only when a real boundary needs an abstraction. If one
  concrete implementation is enough, inject the concrete class.
- Prefer clean, focused services over generic `Manager`, `Helper`, `Utils`, or
  vague `Handler` classes.
- Do not create empty folders or tests just to satisfy an architecture diagram.

## Standard Workflow

When implementing:

1. Identify the user-facing action or behavior being added or migrated.
2. Put delivery parsing and serialization in the framework-specific adapter.
3. Put externally meaningful application flow in a use case.
4. Put reusable focused behavior in services.
5. Inject dependencies with `Injected[...]`; do not instantiate collaborators
   inside use cases/services unless they are simple values.
6. Register dependencies only when auto-wiring cannot express the binding.
7. Add focused tests and architecture checks only where they protect behavior or
   a boundary that matters.

For existing repos, migrate one user-facing action at a time. Move that path
behind a use case/service boundary, wire it with `diwire`, run the relevant
checks, then repeat.

## Before Finishing

Check:

- Core use cases/services do not import delivery adapters, framework entrypoint
  objects, request/response schemas, or `diwire.Container`.
- Explicit container registrations are limited to abstractions, factories,
  existing instances, or external adapter bindings.
- Tests override dependencies before resolving the object graph.
- `foundation/`, if present, contains only stable cross-layer primitives.
- Repo agent instructions, if added or changed, are concise and command-focused.

Use the repo's existing commands first. Typical checks are:

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy .
```

Report exactly which checks ran and any checks that could not run.
